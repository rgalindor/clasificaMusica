# Music classifier


This repo contains scripts that can extract information from audio files such as:

 - `mp3`
 - `wav`

it requires `vlc` software to produce a plain text file containing changes in the amplitude of the sound wave in `txt` files. The purpose is to use such files for different types of classifiers.
